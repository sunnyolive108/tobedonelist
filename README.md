A FastAPI-based backend for task management, with support for scheduling reminders and notifications . . . 

Project Structure
Here is the recommended project structure:

```
/src
    /backend
        ├── app.py           # Main FastAPI app
        ├── task_manager.py  # Task management logic
        ├── models.py        # Data models (task, user, etc.)
        ├── api.py           # API endpoints
        └── requirements.txt  # List of dependencies
```
Explanation:

app.py: The main FastAPI application where routes are defined.
task_manager.py: Contains the logic for managing tasks, including adding, removing, and updating tasks.
models.py: Defines the data models for the application (e.g., Task, User, etc.), typically using Pydantic for validation and SQLAlchemy for ORM.
api.py: The file containing the API routes and business logic.
requirements.txt: A file that lists all required Python packages for the backend to run.

Backend Environment Setup

Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
First, create a Python virtual environment to keep your dependencies isolated from your system’s global Python installation.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
Step 2: Install Dependencies
The requirements.txt file contains all the necessary Python packages for the backend. To install the dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
Code kopieren
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install:

FastAPI: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.
Uvicorn: ASGI server to run the FastAPI app.
Pydantic: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
SQLAlchemy: ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) to interact with a database.
APScheduler: A library to schedule tasks (e.g., reminders, notifications).
Step 3: Run the FastAPI Application
After installing the dependencies, you can run the FastAPI app using Uvicorn.
```bash
Code kopieren
uvicorn src.backend.app:app --reload
```
This will start the server on http://localhost:8000.

Step 4: Access the API Documentation
FastAPI automatically generates and serves interactive API documentation. Once the server is running, navigate to the following URLs:

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
ReDoc UI: http://localhost:8000/redoc
Example Usage
Here’s an example of how to use the API to create a task:

Create a Task

Endpoint: POST /tasks/
Body (JSON):
```json
{
  "title": "Finish the project",
  "due_date": "2025-01-31T12:00:00",
  "priority": "high"
}
```
Response (JSON):
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Finish the project",
  "due_date": "2025-01-31T12:00:00",
  "priority": "high"
}
```
Get All Tasks

Endpoint: GET /tasks/
Response:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Finish the project",
    "due_date": "2025-01-31T12:00:00",
    "priority": "high"
  },
  ...
]
```
Running the Application with Docker (Optional)
If you prefer to run the application inside a Docker container, you can use the provided Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml. Here's how you can do it:

Step 1: Build and Start the Docker Container
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Step 2: Access the Application
Once the container is up, you can access the application at http://localhost:8000.

Running Tests
If you have tests set up (e.g., using pytest), you can run them with:

```bash
pytest
```
Ensure you have the test dependencies installed by adding them to your requirements.txt file or using a separate requirements-test.txt file.
